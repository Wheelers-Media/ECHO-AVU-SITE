it's the AI model is ever confused on how to build a page or how to structure a section or something. We must always refer to the reference folder and files to find a solution. Or the echo audio video current old website "https://echoavu.ca" to get an idea of the information to put on certain websites because although we do want to change how they talk and frame themselves for more premium. Brand for the consumers but as far as information like their address and their language that they already use like price matching and stuff like that all that information kind of stays the same as their current website.
