                        The number one complaint we hear from clients looking to improve their boardroom is lack of
                        compatibility. The need for a boardroom that's fully compatible with all available hardware and
                        software will be essential to making the transition from working from home, to in office
                        meetings a smooth one. Here we will go over some of the most common things to consider when

                        <p>In 2021, there are many different ways to host a meeting, all using different hardware and
                            software. The first key consideration for your boardroom is who will be using the space?
                            Will it solely be used by a tech-savvy sales team, or does every member of your team need
                            the ability to easily host meetings? If your company is closer to the latter you will want
                            to ensure your presentation space is fully compatible with the latest (and past) technology.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="text-white font-bold">Hardware Compatibility</h4>
                        <p>Theres nothing more frustrating than showing up to give your big presentation, and finding
                            out the projector only takes a VGA port when your MacBook Pro is running full 4K HDMI. To
                            ensure full compatibility with the various available video sources, we utilize a multi-port
                            scaler which will automatically size the video source based on what your screen/projector
                            can handle. If youre using a 4K TV as your screen, the scaler will automatically upscale
                            incoming lower resolution video to 4K.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-white font-bold">Software Compatibility</h4>
                        <p>During the COVID pandemic businesses have utilized a variety of software to facilitate
                            virtual meetings all over the world. While Zoom is the market leader, Microsoft Teams,
                            Skype, GoToMeeting, Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, and TeamViewer are also popular
                            meeting options. We avoid having to download and install new software right when your
                            meeting is about to start by utilizing a presentation hub as part of the boardroom
                            installation. The presentation hub lets you easily mirror your screen, and host virtual
                            meetings on all video streaming services. Keep the ideas flowing and easily share screens
                            between laptops, smartphones, and tablets wirelessly. No matter what hardware or software
                            someone brings into the boardroom, our goal is that it just works.</p>

                        When deciding on whether to use a projector or a TV in your boardroom, the main consideration is
                        the size and layout of the room. Is this a boardroom for 4 people, or 15 people? The larger the
                        room, the more a projector, which can display at 120? across, is the right option. However, also
                        consider the room layout. Projectors require dimmed lighting for the picture to not be washed
                        out. Does your boardroom have large windows that allow significant amounts of ambient light? Are
                        you willing to add automated window coverings? Can the lighting be dimmed or would that not make
                        sense for your space/business? In smaller, or very bright boardrooms, a TV screen may be the
                        best option.

                        Here the size and layout will again greatly factor into the decision on what devices are best
                        suited for your use case. The number of people typically in a meeting will determine whether
                        your webcam needs to be wide-angle, and if it needs the ability to zoom in on whoever is
                        speaking. Does every seat need its own dedicated mic, or would a single omnidirectional
                        microphone in the centre of the table be more appropriate? Will the speakers on the TV screen be
                        enough, or is the boardroom large enough to warrant in-wall or in-ceiling speakers? These are
                        some of the things to be considered when determining what type of a/v hardware to use.

                        amplifier to control volume levels so that each room has specific requirements met according to

                        Ultimately this will depend on factors like your ceiling height, your room layout, and decor.
                        That being said, for office layouts, a good rule of thumb is if you have 10 ft. ceilings, each
                        speaker will cover about 400 sq ft. Having multiple speakers also gives you the ability to set a
                        lower, but consistent volume across the office. Having a single speaker in a corner can lead to
                        situations where the volume is too loud for those closest to the speaker, and too quiet for
                        those across the room.

                        Ultimately this will depend on factors like your ceiling height, your room layout, and decor.
                        That being said, for office layouts, a good rule of thumb is if you have 10 ft. ceilings, each
                        speaker will cover about 400 sq ft. Having multiple speakers also gives you the ability to set a
                        lower, but consistent volume across the office. Having a single speaker in a corner can lead to
                        situations where the volume is too loud for those closest to the speaker, and too quiet for
                        those across the room.
