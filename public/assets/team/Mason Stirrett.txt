Hey there! My name is Mason Stirrett and I’ve recently joined the crew at Echo Audio in January of this year. I have always had a huge interest for anything related with loud music and the audio world. My passion started when I was just a kid, playing an electric set of drums which inevitably lead me to where I am now thrashing sticks and going onto 10 years as a drummer. Once I got a little older, upgrading and attempting to spruce up my stereo in my first truck kick started my love for the truck & car scene here locally in Grande Prairie as well. I have learned so much already, and have had a blast meeting new people and being able to impact others with my job. Being able to see the reactions and the glow people have when they get to enjoy something I’ve had the privilege of working on makes the job even more rewarding. Looking forward to the future here and continuing my journey with my opportunities here at Echo Audio. See you all at the store!
