                            at the General hospital. (That's right, I'm that old, lol.) I've always been into stereos
                            and installing and that passion has never changed. Even back in the day, running around with
                            the Echo Sound gull-winged civic bringing home trophies for loudest stereo, all because my
                            best friend just happened to work there. &#128513; Shortly after, I started to help Jeff,
                            doing deliveries and home setups, even though I worked at a competitor, lol. Then, in 2002,
                            I was offered a job that changed my life. I was taken in by Bruce, Cathy, and the Echo Sound
                            crew and, right off the bat, treated like family. To this day, I still love working at a
                            true family business where I get to do what I love and work with all the great people here.
                            It has truly been a blessing. Thank you to all the customers that allow me to work on their
                            stuff and then are as excited as I am when I hand it back over, still gives me goosebumps to
                            this day. Can't wait for my next install!" </p>

                            meticulous mounting of TV brackets, speakers and more. Being a part of the Echo Family has

                            and the audio world. My passion started when I was just a kid, playing an electric set of
                            drums which inevitably lead me to where I am now thrashing sticks and going onto 10 years as
                            a drummer. Once I got a little older, upgrading and attempting to spruce up my stereo in my
                            first truck kick started my love for the truck & car scene here locally in Grande Prairie as
                            well. I have learned so much already, and have had a blast meeting new people and being able
                            to impact others with my job. Being able to see the reactions and the glow people have when
                            they get to enjoy something I’ve had the privilege of working on makes the job even more
                            rewarding. Looking forward to the future here and continuing my journey with my
                            opportunities here at Echo Audio. See you all at the store!"
